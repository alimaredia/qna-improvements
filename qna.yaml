      InstructLab is a model-agnostic open source AI project that facilitates
      contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs).
      We are on a mission to let anyone shape generative
      AI by enabling contributed updates to existing
      LLMs in an accessible way. Our community welcomes all those who
      would like to help us enable everyone to shape
      the future of generative AI.

      - question: |
          What is InstructLab?
        answer: |
          InstructLab is an open source AI project
          that allows anyone contribute to Large Language Models (LLMs).
      - question: |
          What is the mission of InstructLab?
        answer: |
          InstructLab is on a mission to let anyone
          contribute updates to existing LLMs.
      - question: |
          Is InstructLab open source AI project?
        answer: |
          Yes, InstructLab is a model-agnostic
          open source AI project that facilitates
          contributions to Large Language Models (LLMs).
  - context: |
      There are many projects rapidly embracing
      and extending permissively licensed AI models,
      but they are faced with three main challenges:
      contribution to LLMs is not possible directly.
      They show up as forks, which forces consumers
      to choose a "best-fit" model that isn't easily extensible.
      Also, the forks are expensive for model
      creators to maintain.
      The ability to contribute ideas is limited
      by a lack of AI/ML expertise. One has to learn how
      to fork, train, and refine models to
      see their idea move forward. This is a high
      barrier to entry. There is no direct
      community governance or best practice around
      review, curation, and distribution of forked models.
      InstructLab is here to solve these problems.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What are some challenges of contributing
          to or extending existing open LLMs?
        answer: |
          The first challenge is that you cannot contribute directly 
          to an open LLM. Open LLMs with custom contributions show up 
          as forks. The second challenge is, the ability to contribute 
          is limited by the lack of AI/ML expertise among potential 
          contributors.
      - question: |
          Are there any best practices for working with forked models?
        answer: |
          There are no best practices for working with forked models. 
          Forked models do not have direct community governance 
          around the review, curation, and distribution.
      - question: |
          What problems is Instructlab aiming to solve?
        answer: |
          The Instructlab project solves  three challenges.
          The first is that like Contribution to LLMs is not possible directly.
          The second challenge is that the ability to contribute ideas 
          to LLMs is limited by a lack of AI/ML expertise.
          The third challenge InstructLab solves is there is no 
          direct community governance or best practice around review, 
          curation, and distribution of forked models.

      The "lab" in InstructLab stands for Large-Scale
      Alignment for ChatBots.
      The InstructLab project is sponsored by Red Hat.
      InstructLab was originally created by engineers

      The infrastructure used to regularly train models
      based on new contributions from the
      community is donated and maintained by IBM.
